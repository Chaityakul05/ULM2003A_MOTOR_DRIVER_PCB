This project tests the ULN2003A Darlington transistor array using an ESP32/ESP8266 and a simple LED circuit. The setup demonstrates how the ULN2003A sinks current through its outputs when the corresponding input is triggered by a GPIO pin from the ESP. An LED connected between a 5V supply and OUT1 lights up when IN1 is driven HIGH, verifying proper operation of the IC. This test helps in understanding how to interface the ULN2003A with microcontrollers to control loads like LEDs, motors, or relays.
